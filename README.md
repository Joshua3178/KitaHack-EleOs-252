# KitaHack-EleOs-252
Repo Overview: This Repo is a condensed version of a computer Visual Language Model design capable of detecting special unfortunate cases such as bleeding in points during surgery. the basis concept uses Google OWLv2 to propose bounding boxes for two safety-relevant categories: bleeding regions and potentially left-behind surgical equipment. Optionally, it can refine detections with SAM2 segmentation masks, apply tiling for large images, run group-wise NMS, and generate visual overlays plus JSON reports.
